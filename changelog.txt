  without an additional sublevel.

- The start page of the blog doesn't have to be the page above the blog postings. The blog postings can be
  entered as subpages of another page, which has to be given as first argument in the miniblog plugin call.
  To make backlinks work in this case, this page has to be entered additionally in the language file.
- Backlinks can additionally be created below the blog posting.
- Number of posts shown blog starting page can be put into several numbered page views with a limited amout of posts each. 
- 2 columns in blog page possible, responsive goes to 1 column below 500px viewport width
- With the help of cmb's extedit every logged-in member can create, edit and delete his own blog postings in single files.
